To trace and display the distributed traces in your Spring Boot project with Sleuth, you can integrate it with a tracing system like Zipkin or Jaeger. Here's how you can set it up:

Step 1: Choose a Tracing System
Select a tracing system that suits your needs. Two popular choices are Zipkin and Jaeger. For this example, let's use Zipkin.

Step 2: Add Zipkin Dependency
Add the Zipkin client dependency to your project's `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file:

For Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-zipkin</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Step 3: Configure Zipkin Endpoint
In your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file, configure the endpoint for your Zipkin server:

For `application.properties`:
```properties
spring.zipkin.base-url=http://your-zipkin-server:9411
```

For `application.yml`:
```yaml
spring:
  zipkin:
    base-url: http://your-zipkin-server:9411
```

Step 4: Start Zipkin Server
Start the Zipkin server by running it locally or deploying it to your desired environment. 
Make sure it's accessible at the configured base URL.

Step 5: View Traces
With the Zipkin server running and your Spring Boot application integrated with Sleuth, you can now view traces.

1. Access the Zipkin server's UI by navigating to `http://your-zipkin-server:9411` in your browser.
2. Perform actions in your Spring Boot application that generate distributed traces.
3. Refresh the Zipkin UI, and you should see the traces displayed.

The traces will show the spans corresponding to the traced operations, including the Kafka messaging operations.

Note: Make sure that your Kafka consumer and producer methods are instrumented with Sleuth annotations (`@NewSpan`, `@ContinueSpan`, etc.) if you want to have finer-grained control over the traced operations.

That's it! You have now set up tracing and can view the distributed traces in your Spring Boot project using a 
tracing system like Zipkin.
