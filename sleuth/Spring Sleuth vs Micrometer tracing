Spring Sleuth vs Micrometer tracing


Spring Cloud Sleuth and Micrometer tracing are two different libraries that serve different purposes in the context of distributed tracing and monitoring.

1. Spring Cloud Sleuth:

   - Purpose: Spring Cloud Sleuth is a distributed tracing solution specifically designed for Spring Boot applications. It helps trace requests as they propagate across multiple microservices or components of a distributed system. It provides unique trace and span identifiers to requests, enabling you to visualize and analyze the flow and performance of requests across different services.

   - Functionality: Spring Cloud Sleuth integrates with popular distributed tracing systems like Zipkin and Jaeger. It automatically instruments your application's components, such as HTTP clients, message queues, and database calls, to capture and propagate tracing information.

   - Features: Spring Cloud Sleuth provides features like trace and span propagation, automatic instrumentation, sampling, and integration with external tracing systems.

   - Use cases: Spring Cloud Sleuth is commonly used when you want to trace requests across multiple services in a distributed system and gain insights into request flow, latency, and performance.



2. Micrometer Tracing:

   - Purpose: Micrometer is a metrics collection library that provides a consistent API for capturing and publishing application metrics. It offers support for distributed tracing as an extension to its metric collection capabilities. Micrometer tracing allows you to capture and visualize traces alongside other metrics in your application.

   - Functionality: Micrometer tracing enables you to collect distributed traces using various tracing systems like Zipkin, Jaeger, or Sleuth. It integrates with these systems to capture trace information, including trace IDs, span IDs, and timing data.

   - Features: Micrometer tracing provides integration with tracing systems, the ability to instrument code to capture traces, and the flexibility to export traces along with other metrics to monitoring systems.

   - Use cases: Micrometer tracing is often used when you want to capture and analyze distributed traces within the broader context of your application's metrics and monitoring.


Why Micrometer Tracing with Spring Boot 3.2 instead of Spring Sleuth?

- Micrometer tracing is not a replacement for Spring Sleuth but rather an additional capability that complements Micrometer's existing metric collection functionality. Micrometer tracing provides a unified API to capture both metrics and distributed traces, making it convenient for developers who are already using Micrometer for metrics collection.

- Spring Sleuth, on the other hand, is designed specifically for distributed tracing and integrates tightly with Spring Boot applications. It provides features like automatic instrumentation and integration with popular tracing systems.

- Choosing between Micrometer tracing and Spring Sleuth depends on your specific use case and requirements. If you are already using Micrometer for metrics and want to include distributed tracing seamlessly with the same API and integration points, Micrometer tracing can be a good choice. However, if you are primarily focused on distributed tracing in a Spring Boot application, Spring Sleuth provides dedicated features and deeper integration.

In summary, Micrometer tracing and Spring Sleuth serve different purposes and have different design philosophies. Micrometer tracing is a convenient option if you are already using Micrometer for metrics and want to include distributed tracing alongside metrics. Spring Sleuth is a more specialized solution specifically tailored for distributed tracing in Spring Boot applications.
